<h2>Life of Saint Peter Window – Bay 110</h2>
<p>This stained glass window is located in <b>Bay 110</b> on the south side of the nave in <b>Chartres Cathedral</b>. 
It was created around <b>1210–1220</b> and is dedicated to the life, miracles, and martyrdom of <b>Saint Peter</b>. 
The window was likely funded by the <b>fishmongers' guild</b>, a common sponsor for windows featuring apostles associated with the sea. 
While no single artist is named, it was produced by the skilled glaziers of the Chartres workshop. 
The window has undergone several <b>restorations</b>, most recently in the 20th century to stabilize lead work and clean pigments while preserving original glass wherever possible.</p>
